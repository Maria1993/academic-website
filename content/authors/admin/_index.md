BSc in Biology from the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC), where she collaborated for two years with the research group "Biodiversity, Biogeography and Invertebrate Conservation" (BIBICI) in the development of the complete taxonomy of different species of Terrestrial Gastropods of the Iberian Peninsula, this being part of her bachelor project. During her MSc Aquaculture she was a part of the "Marine Genetic Resources" group (ReXenMar) of the University of Vigo (Uvigo) and the "AquaCOV" group of the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO-CSIC). Her master project focused on the phylogeny of the genus Merluccius, thus obtaining knowledge in bioinformatics and different methods of phylogenetic reconstruction. This work formed the beginning of her doctoral thesis, during which she collaborated for three months with the company NOFIMA AS (Tromso, Norway) to analyze the morphological and genetic markers that influence the quality of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) egg. Her doctoral thesis allowed her to develop her knowledge in aquaculture, experimental design and gene expression analysis, which she complemented with teaching (support staff) and scientific dissemination. 
Among the science dissemination activities carried out during her thesis, it is worth highlighting the creation of the dissemination event "Marathon: 8 minutes of marine dissemination".
