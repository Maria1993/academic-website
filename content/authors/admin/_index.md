I am a postdoctoral researcher of applied population genetics at the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources. My research interests include molecular ecology, evolutionary biology, population genomics and fisheries science. I am part of the genetics working group within the NORSUSTAIN project, aiming to understand the population structure and dynamics of Greenland halibut, an important commercial fish species in the North Atlantic and the Arctic. The knowledge from this project can contribute to informed management plans that guarantee sustainable exploitation of this fishery.
