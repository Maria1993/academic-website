abstract = {In times of overfishing and climate change, marine resources are extremely vulnerable, and the vast majority of the world's fish stocks have already collapsed. In this fragile context, the need to drive fisheries toward sustainability has become a priority. Population genomics methods, which compare DNA of individuals from different populations occupying distinct environments, are promising tools to address such need. Indeed, these methods provide new knowledge on the demographic and adaptive history of marine resources, which allows fisheries-specific issues to be resolved, so that delineation of stocks coincides with actual population boundaries and genetic diversity is maintained, ensuring the long-term sustainability of resources. In addition, the field of population genomics applied to fisheries management, or commonly referred to as “fisheries genomics,” has benefited from emerging molecular approaches that can now address fisheries management issues that could not previously be addressed. This genomics revolution is accompanied by an apparent increase in information and resolution on the main causes of marine population differentiation, which makes it possible to assess the persistence of marine species in the face of climate change and overfishing, two major threats at the heart of fisheries management issues. In this chapter, I synthesize information on empirical examples of the application of population genomics to fisheries and provide suggestions as to how modern population genomics approaches could address some of the most urgent challenges in fisheries management and conservation. I discuss the application of genomics to fishery management and conservation from four main angles: stock structure, climate change, forensics, and fishery-induced evolution.},

@article{Reiss2009,
abstract = {An essential prerequisite of a sustainable fisheries management is the matching of biologically relevant processes and management action. In fisheries management and assessment, fish stocks are the fundamental biological unit, but the reasoning for the operational management unit is often indistinct and mismatches between the biology and the management action frequently occur. Despite the plethora of population genetic data on marine fishes, to date little or no use is made of the information, despite the fact that the detection of genetic differentiation may indicate reproductively distinct populations. Here, we discuss key aspects of genetic population differentiation in the context of their importance for fisheries management. Furthermore, we evaluate the population structure of all 32 managed marine fish species in the north-east Atlantic and relate this structure to current management units and practice. Although a large number of studies on genetic population structure have been published in the last decades, data are still rare for most exploited species. The mismatch between genetic population structure and the current management units found for six species (Gadus morhua, Melanogrammus aeglefinus, Merlangius merlangus, Micromesistius poutassou, Merluccius merluccius and Clupea harengus), emphasizes the need for a revision of these units and questions the appropriateness of current management measures. The implementation of complex and dynamic population structures into novel and less static management procedures should be a primary task for future fisheries management approaches. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Waples2008,
abstract = {Molecular genetic data have found widespread application in the identification of population and conservation units for aquatic species. However, integration of genetic information into actual management has been slow, and explicit and quantitative inclusion of genetic data into fisheries models is rare. In part, this reflects the inherent difficulty in using genetic markers to draw inferences about demographic independence, which is generally the information of the greatest short-term interest to fishery managers. However, practical management constraints, institutional structures and communication issues have also contributed to the lack of integration. This paper identifies some of the organizational, conceptual and technical barriers that have hampered full use of genetics data in stock assessment and hence fishery management and outlines how such use could be enhanced.},
